# Sensor-Modeling

Contains data and input files for calculations of Henry's Coefficient with RASPA and structural properties with Zeo++.

### Content

* CH4, CO2, H2O, N2, N2O and O2 folders contain Henry's Coefficient data, simulation input files, and submission/extraction scripts
* Structure_Property_Analysis contains Zeo++ files for property calculations and raw data
* unit_cell contains files used to determine optimal unit cell for RASPA Henry's Coefficient input files
* Data_collection is used to compile Henry's Coefficient data from each molecule folder
* FinalData.csv contains all selectivity and property values
